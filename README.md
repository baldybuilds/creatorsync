## üèóÔ∏è **Environment Architecture**

### **Local Development**
- **Purpose**: Independent development environment
- **Database**: Local PostgreSQL instance
- **Clerk**: Development environment with test users
- **Domain**: `localhost:3000` (frontend) + `localhost:8080` (backend)

### **Staging (QA Environment)**
- **Purpose**: Production mirror for quality assurance testing
- **Database**: **Production database** (shared with production)
- **Clerk**: **Production Clerk environment** (same user IDs as production)
- **Domain**: `dev.creatorsync.app` (frontend) + `api-dev.creatorsync.app` (backend)
- **Users**: Real production users can test new features before release

### **Production**
- **Purpose**: Live environment for end users
- **Database**: Production PostgreSQL database
- **Clerk**: Production Clerk environment
- **Domain**: `creatorsync.app` (frontend) + `api.creatorsync.app` (backend)

## ‚úÖ **Benefits of This Architecture**

1. **True QA Testing**: Staging uses identical data and users as production
2. **No Cross-Environment Issues**: Staging Clerk user IDs match database user IDs
3. **Real User Testing**: Production users can safely test new features on staging
4. **Simplified Deployment**: No complex data syncing between environments
5. **Consistent User Experience**: Same OAuth tokens and user profiles across environments

## üöÄ **Deployment**

### Staging Deployment
```bash
git push origin staging
```
- Deploys to Railway staging service with production database connection
- Uses production Clerk environment for authentication
- Available at staging domains for QA testing

### Production Deployment
```bash
git push origin production
```
- Deploys to Railway production service
- Uses production database and Clerk environment
- Available at production domains for end users
